That is good for business question #2 when we are trying to say, within the date range chosen by the user, how much of the variance in the response variable can be explained by the different Xs.  However, for the forecast question (biz question #4 in the slides), if we want to test on unseen data, then then \"training set\" (which will get further split between train vs validation during cross-validation) may need to cut of at an earlier date.  Would be useful, somewhere at the start of this script, to put in two input parameters for us to set the date range we want to run this data cleaning script for."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MYaqO1GihQTJ"},"source":["**Response variable 1) Change in AUM per investor**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"z5SKgFoFUZrz"},"source":["**Apply \"Groupby\" based on investor_id**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cPITi4p0TMCH","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1601350465575,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":745,"user":{"displayName":"Trafalgar Law","photoUrl":"","userId":"07505374984179426558"}}},"source":["keys=['investor_id']\n"],"execution_count":147,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"52zneamsGVel","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1601350467651,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":830,"user":{"displayName":"Trafalgar Law","photoUrl":"","userId":"07505374984179426558"}},"outputId":"f785dda4-c97d-4c1e-9830-82baa6c567db","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":272}},"source":["grouped=df1.groupby(keys)\n","grouped.sum().head()"],"execution_count":148,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>\n","      <th>Units</th>\n","      <th>income</th>\n","      <th>riskscore</th>\n","      <th>subscribed</th>\n","      <th>opened</th>\n","      <th>SCRate</th>\n","      <th>TRate</th>\n","      <th>Price</th>\n","      <th>return-N6M</th>\n","      <th>return-HYG</th>\n","      <th>return-IVV</th>\n","      <th>HYG_txn_cnt</th>\n","      <th>IVV_txn_cnt</th>\n","      <th>N6M_txn_cnt</th>\n","      <th>Txn_Val</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>investor_id</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>10252</th>\n","      <td>1968</td>\n","      <td>17.085624</td>\n","      <td>25580.11645</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.03</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>72.989998</td>\n","      <td>0.000000</td>\n","      <td>-0.044133</td>\n","      <td>-0.055680</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1247.079660</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>11042</th>\n","      <td>8481</td>\n","      <td>0.000000</td>\n","      <td>118059.40506</td>\n","      <td>10</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.10</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>471.279999</td>\n","      <td>0.009925</td>\n","      <td>-0.077391</td>\n","      <td>-0.160773</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>11.843152</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>11236</th>\n","      <td>2813</td>\n","      <td>30.493289</td>\n","      <td>124125.49990</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.05</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>240.119995</td>\n","      <td>0.002804</td>\n","      <td>-0.054966</td>\n","      <td>-0.115743</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>7322.048361</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>11431</th>\n","      <td>2471</td>\n","      <td>1.753056</td>\n","      <td>20472.16172</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.05</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>248.960007</td>\n","      <td>-0.014493</td>\n","      <td>-0.039955</td>\n","      <td>-0.096236</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>436.440784</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>11770</th>\n","      <td>2240</td>\n","      <td>-5.090563</td>\n","      <td>47994.40091</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.05</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>271.549988</td>\n","      <td>-0.016544</td>\n","      <td>0.031439</td>\n","      <td>0.090737</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>-1382.342405</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["             Unnamed: 0      Units  ...
